// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.

// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

const favouritefruit = ["Mango", "Grapes", "Peach"]
if( favouritefruit.includes("banana") ){
    console.log("You really like bananas")
}
if( favouritefruit.includes("Mango") ){
    console.log("You really like Mangoes")
}
if( favouritefruit.includes("Grapes") ){
    console.log("You really like Grapes")
}
if( favouritefruit.includes("Peach") ){
    console.log("You really like Peaches")
}
if( favouritefruit.includes("Apple") ){
